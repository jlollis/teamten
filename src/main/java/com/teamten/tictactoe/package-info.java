/**
 * This is an unfinished experiment to see if the computer can pick moves
 * in Tic Tac Toe that are most likely to cause human error. Normally a
 * Tic Tac Toe-playing program will see the entire tree, realize it's
 * a tie for best play, and play anything. But surely some moves will
 * have obvious replies and some non-obvious best replies, and this attempts
 * to figure that out.

To run:

    ant -find build.xml && java -cp ../../../../classes com.teamten.mario.Mario

- Name ideas:
    - Ask Milo.
- Game ideas:
    - Replace ball with running person.
        - Fixed speed will greatly improve search speed.
        - Person is more anthropomorphic than ball.
        - Have vertical acceleration but no horizontal acceleration.
    - Must push switches or levers to move to next level.
    - Make toys players (or have superclass) so that they can fall and move around.
        - Balls or other players will probably make search intractable.
    - When picking up balls, can't get through balls that are too big.
        - They block you.
        - You push them around.
    - Make ball destination fixed, goal of player is to stop/help ball by moving environment.
        - Stop:
            - Maybe more fun.
            - How do you get to next level?
                - Limited time.
                    - Makes no sense.
                - Trick into going to wrong place.
                - No next level, continuous play, just gets harder and harder.
        - Help:
            - Move floors to make a path.
            - Sound pretty boring.
        - Might be stress-inducing to have to do something, can't just rest.
        - But maybe more addictive that way.
    - Have some obstacles/objects not visible to look-ahead search.
    - Control real ball completely, bad ball is trying to catch up with you.
- Debt:
    - Must take into account env equality when searching.
        - Cache withoutToy() versions for faster equality checks.
    - Consider writing our own priority queue that's also a hash table.
        - First count the size of queue when removing to determine O(N).
    - Comment all code.
    - Draw search space faster.
